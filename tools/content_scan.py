"""Fail when the repo holds content that it must not hold.

Usage: python tools/content_scan.py           scans OpenLancer (the submodule is excluded)
       python tools/content_scan.py --fork    scans the changes of the engine fork against its base commit

The scan checks every file that git tracks or would add:
  1. Retail file types (disc images, cabinets, fonts, UTF models and textures, cutscenes) are not allowed. The
     thumbnails of the editor (.olthumb) are not allowed either, because the editor renders them from game data.
     The one exception is a THN patch of a mod (decision D70): an ASCII .thn file below the patches/ folder of a
     mod (the patches/ folder next to its mod.json) whose first statement after its comment block is
     "ol_thn_patch = 1". A patch holds only keys and changed values.
  2. No file starts with the signature of a retail container: "BINI", "UTF " or compiled Lua. No file starts with
     "OLTH", the signature of a thumbnail of the editor.
  3. No binary file, unless tools/content_scan_allow.txt allows it.
  4. No C, C++ or assembly source. Native code belongs in the engine fork.
  5. Only the Markdown files in MARKDOWN_FILES.
  6. No decompiler output in code files: automatic names, decompiler helpers, retail code addresses, and in
     comments the register notes of IDA, the names of decompilers and the word "decompiled". Markdown files get
     the rules that check the whole line.
  7. No file may have the same SHA-256 as a game file in a manifest of data-manifest/ (each <build id>.tsv, for
     example vanilla-1.0.tsv and hde-0.7.1.tsv). A text file is also checked in its LF form and its CRLF form,
     because git can change line ends.
--fork applies rules 1, 2, 3 and 7 to the files that the fork adds or changes after the base commit in
docs/UPSTREAM.md, and rule 6 to the lines that the fork adds.
Exit code 0 means clean. Exit code 1 means the scan found a problem.

The tests are in tools/test_content_scan.py: python -B -m unittest discover -s tools
